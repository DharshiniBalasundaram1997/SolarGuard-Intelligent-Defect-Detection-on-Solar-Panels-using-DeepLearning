âœ… #*Project Overview Goal:*
- Develop a system to:
      - â†’ Classify solar panel images by condition (e.g., Dusty, Clean)
      - â†’ Detect and localize obstructions or damages using object detection
      - â†’ Deploy results via an interactive Streamlit app for real-time inspection and maintenance recommendations

ðŸ”§ ##*Key Components:*

**1. Image Classification (Deep Learning â€“ CNN):**
   ***Goal:*** Predict the condition of solar panels
   ***Target:*** One of six classes (Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, Snow-Covered)
   ***Model Suggestions:*** ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, EfficientNet
   ***Aim:*** Automate classification of solar panels to prioritize maintenance

**2. Object Detection (YOLOv8 or Faster R-CNN)**
   ***Goal:*** Identify and localize issues (e.g., dust, bird droppings, damage)
   ***Target:*** Bounding boxes with class labels
   ***Model Suggestions:*** YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN
   ***Aim:*** Enable pinpointed cleaning or repair rather than full panel replacement

ðŸš€ ##*Approach Summary*

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   * Resize images to 224x224
   * Normalize pixel values
   * Annotate images for object detection using LabelImg
   * Perform image augmentation to balance classes

2. **ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   * Visual inspection of defect samples
   * Analyze class distribution
   * Identify patterns in defect frequency
   * Compare occurrences across conditions (e.g., more snow in winter months)

3. **Model Training**
   * Classification: CNN (ResNet, MobileNet, etc.)
   * Object Detection: YOLOv8 trained with bounding box annotations and .yaml config

4. **ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation**
   * Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   * Object Detection Metrics: mAP (Mean Average Precision), IoU (Intersection over Union)

5. **ðŸ’» Deployment (Streamlit App)**
-  Users upload images to get:
   - â†’ Panel condition classification
   - â†’ Detected bounding boxes on defective areas
   - Visual display of model results and metrics (e.g., accuracy, mAP)

#*Final Output:*
1. **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
2. **Object Detection:** mAP, IoU
3. **Streamlit Application:** Real-time image analysis and visualization
